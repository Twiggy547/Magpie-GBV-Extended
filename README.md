# Magpie Grid Banner Variant (Extended) - A Theme for [Playnite](https://playnite.link/)
 Just a version of Dan Davis's Magpie GBV updated with more extensions than default and even more flexibility!
 Thank you Dan for this awesome Layout!
 
 ### Information and settings I use for addons and Playnite can be found in the wiki linked below.
 ## [Addon-Settings](https://github.com/Twiggy547/Magpie-GBV-Extended/wiki/Addon-Settings/)
 
## Design Goals:
 * __Metro Style__ - Heavily influenced by the [Metro for Steam Skin](https://www.metroforsteam.com/) and Epic Launcher's clean design.
 * __Clear but Unobtrusive Layout__ - Your interest is the games; Magpie will not distract you from them but help you parse your large and detailed library easily.
 * __Flexible Appearance__ - I have favorite colors and feelings about font families, transparency, and border thickness. Sometimes they change so I'm sure you do too. I've made Magpie to look good and respect your preferences from font sizes, to amount of information, to whether you want a focused darkroom effect or an edge-to-edge display for your games' media. For those that need more control, variables to adjust color, control corner roundness, or transparency are accessible from the main Constants.xaml or use of the ThemeModifier plugin.

## Outstanding Features:
 * __[ThemeModifier](https://playnite.link/forum/thread-388.html) by Lacro59 support.__ If you don't like my color scheme or want to adjust the transparency, you can do it yourself.
 * __Logo & Header Support__ without compromising existing metadata like icons. Thanks to a hack learned from joyrider3774, logos may optionally be added to your games.
 * __Rounded cover corners!__ I think they look nice.
